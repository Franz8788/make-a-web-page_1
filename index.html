<h2>Part 1</h2>
</div>

<div class= "main-sections">
<h3>The internet in general</h3>
<p>The <b>internet</b> is the largest global computer network. How does it work? Basically, we need the following elements for it to run: <em>Servers</em>, the <em>internet</em>, the <em>HTTP protocol</em> (Hypertext transfer protocol), and a <em>browser</em> to read the files that are transferred.</p>
</div>

<div class= "main-sections">
<h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
<p><b>HTML</b> is the language used on the internet. The abbreviation stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em> meaning that here is not only text, but also rules how the text is structured. <b>CSS</b>  (Cascading Style Sheets) concern the presentation of a document, which can be changed by changing the CSS.</p>
</div>

<div class= "main-sections">
<h3>HTML elements</h3>
<p><b>HTML</b> elements consist of contents and <em>tags</em>. Tags are made up of tag names and <em>angled brackets</em> surrounding the tag names. Often the contents are wrapped by <em>opening tags</em> and <em>closing tags</em>. But there are also <em>void tags</em> such as &lt;br&gt; (Break). &lt;br&gt; stands alone and needs no closing tag later in the text. Other examples for tags are: &lt;b&gt; (bold, opening tag), &lt;/b&gt; (bold, closing tag), &lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt; for italicized parts, &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; for opening and closing a paragraph.</p>
</div>

<div class= "main-sections">
<h3>Inline and block elements</h3>
<p>In general, <b>inline elements</b> are flowing with the text of the document (for example: &lt;img&gt;), <b>block elements</b> have an invisible box around them (for example: &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt;). But we were assured that for beginners it is not necessary to understand the differences in every detail.</p>
</div>

<div class= "main-sections">
<h3>Links and images</h3>
<p><b>Links</b> are inline elements. Same goes for <b>images</b>. An example for an inactive <em>link</em> is (included here for clarification): &lt;a href=”http://www.udacity.com”&gt;inactive content&lt;/a&gt;. An example for an active <em>link</em> is: <a href=”http://www.udacity.com>active content</a>. href represents an attribute. In the case of images the attribute is not href, but src.</p>
<p><em>Attention</em>: Do not mix up src and href.</p>
</div>

<div class= "main-sections">
<h3> What to remember in any case, part 1</h3>
<h4>What is a webpage?</h4>
<p>A text document which was written in <em>HTML</em>.</p>
<h4>How does coding work?</h4>
<p>Programmers write text in a language computers can understand.</p>
<h4>Why are computers “stupid”?</h4>
<p>Computers take things literally. Small mistakes can have big consequences.</p>
<h4>Do programmers have to remember everything?</h4>
<p>There are <em>too many details</em> to keep in your head. That is why it is okay to look things up.</p>
<h4>How does the basic HTML vocabulary look like?</h4>
<div class= "list">
<ol>
<li><b>Tags</b>: Tags have<em> angled brackets</em>.</li>
<li><b>Elements</b>: All within <em>opening</em> and <em>closing</em> tag plus the tags themselves. </li>
<li><b>Attributes</b>: Are properties of <em>HTML elements</em>. For example to set<br> the href attribute of an anchor tag to http://www.udacity.com<br> (&lt;a href=” http://www.udacity.com”&gt;content&lt;/a&gt;, included again for clarification)</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h2>Part 2</h2>
</div>

<div class= "main-sections">
<h3>Front end development</h3>
<p>Being inherently visual <b>front end development</b> is an excellent starting point for learning programming. HTML and CSS have different purposes. If we compare <b>front end development</b> to building a house, <em>HTML</em> refers to the walls (the <em>structure</em>) and <em>CSS</em> to the <em>style</em> (for example the color of the walls).</p>
</div>

<div class= "main-sections">
<h3>Tree-like structure of web documents</h3>
<p>When programmers speak about the <em>DOM</em> (<em>Domain Object Model</em>), they mean the <b>tree-like structure</b> of web pages. The terminology of DOM elements is similar to <em>family terminology</em> with terms such as <em>parent element</em>, <em>child element</em> or <em>uncle element</em>. A very good way to explore web documents are the <em>developer tools</em> of a browser like <em>Chrome</em>.</p>
</div>

<div class= "main-sections">
<h3>Search for all the boxes</h3>
<p>Programmers with some experience find it easy to see a web document as a set of <b>boxes</b> or to be more correct <em>nested boxes</em>.</p>
</div>

<div class= "main-sections">
<h3>Useful tools for programmers</h3>
<p><em>Scratchpad.io</em> can be used for smaller projects. Otherwise <em>Sublime Text 2</em> is recommended. Of course, every simple <em>text editor</em> can be used, too, but work will progress at a slower pace.</p>
</div>

<div class= "main-sections">
<h3>Avoid repetition</h3>
<p>Programmers want to write code which is as <em>parsimonious</em> as possible. That means <em>repetition</em> must be avoided. One of the advantages of less repetition is fewer mistakes. If programmers have to fix fewer things, there will be less room for error.</p>

</div>

<div class= "main-sections">
<h3>What to remember in any case, part 2</h3>
<h4>What is the visual shape of all HTML elements?</h4>
<p>The shape is always rectangular, even if it is not obvious at first sight.</p>
<h4>If you see a whiteboard with a tree-like structure of connected boxes, what is it?</h4>
<p>It is the DOM (Domain Object Model) of a web page.</p>
<h4>Which situation is rather typical for programming?</h4>
<p>Running into any number of annoying problems. Hopefully they are little.</p>
